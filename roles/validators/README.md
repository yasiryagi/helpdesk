# Overview

This page contains all information on how to setup your node and becoming a `Validator` on the Joystream Testnets. It will be updated for improvements, and when something changes for new testnets.

If you want to earn more `Joy` tokens, but for some reason can´t or won't become a `Validator`, you can `Nominate` instead.

# Instructions

The instructions below covers Windows, Mac and Linux (64 bit and armv7). As a general note, remember to use your `controller` key when setting the `memo` to qualify for the monero rewards.
Some browsers will work better than others, but in general, chrome and chromium based browsers seems to offer the best experience, as it allows the `Pioneer` app to connect to your own node in `Settings`. It seems neither Firefox, Safari or Edge will connect at this time.

If you want to be visible in the polkadot/substrate telemetry, go [here](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/). Note that for windows and armv7 (raspberry pi), you need to add a telemetry flag at startup (see applicable setup node).

If your `Validator` have experienced some of the networking issues described [here](https://github.com/Joystream/substrate-node-joystream/issues/68), consider restarting your node at regular intervals. If you want to automate this process, consider running your node as a [service](#run-as-a-service).

**Note**
After introducing `Memberships` to the platform, we found it to be confusing to have a concept of both `Accounts` and `Memberships`. We are in the process of renaming the `Accounts` to the `Keys`, but there are still traces of `Account` showing up.

# On Your Machine

---

## Windows

* Every time something is written in `<brackets>`, this means you have to replace this with your input, without the `<>`.
* When something is written in `"double_quotes"`, it means the number/data will vary depending on your node or the current state of the blockchain.
* For terminal commands, `>` means you must type what comes after that on windows and mac respectively. `#` Means it's just a comment/explanation, and must not be typed.
```
# This is just a comment, don't type or paste it in your terminal!
> cd C:\joystream-node-1.0.0-windows-x86_64
# Only type/paste the "cd C:\joystream-node-windows-x64", not the preceding > !
```
#### Setup Node

Get the binary [here](https://github.com/Joystream/substrate-node-joystream/releases/download/v1.0.0/joystream-node-1.0.0-windows-x86_64.zip). To make the actual commands the same for all users, I'm going to save it `C:\` and unzip it there. `C:\joystream-node-1.0.0-windows-x86_64`. Feel free to store it somewhere else, just make sure you use the correct path in the instructions that follows.

If you don't have it, download Microsoft Visual Studio C++ runtime distributable 2015 [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ie/download/details.aspx?id=48145).  

Get the missing ssl libraries [here](https://indy.fulgan.com/SSL/openssl-1.0.2q-x64_86-win64.zip), extract, and move the files `ssleay32.dll` and `libeay32.dll` to `C:\joystream-node-windows-x64`.

Open `Command Prompt` (type in cmd... after clicking windows button):

```
> cd C:\joystream-node-1.0.0-windows-x86_64
> joystream-node.exe
# If you want your node to have a non-random identifier:
> joystream-node.exe --name <nodename>
# If you want your node to show up in the telemetry: https://telemetry.polkadot.io/
> joystream-node.exe --name <nodename> --telemetry-url ws://telemetry.polkadot.io:1024/

# Note: due to some issues with our nodes getting mixed up with nodes from the chainX network (see telemetry link),
# it might help your uptime by also passing:
--in-peers 100 --out-peers 100
# after the other flags. You can choose any number you like, but default is 25.
```
Your node should now start syncing the blockchain. The output should look like this:
```
Joystream Node
  version "Version"-"your_OS"
  by Joystream, 2019
Chain specification: Joystream Testnet v2
Node name: "nodename"
Roles: FULL
Generated a new keypair: "some_long_ouput"
Initializing Genesis block/state ("some_long_ouput")
Loaded block-time = 6 seconds from genesis on first-launch startup.
Best block: #0
Local node address is: /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/30333/p2p/"your_node_key"
Listening for new connections on 127.0.0.1:9944.
...
...
Syncing, target=#"block_height" ("n" peers), best: #"synced_height" ("hash_of_synced_tip"), finalized #0 ("hash_of_finalized_tip"), ⬇ "download_speed"iB/s ⬆ "upload_speed"kiB/s
```
From the last line, notice `target=#"block_height"` and `best: #"synced_height"`
When the `target=#block_height`is the same as `best: #"synced_height"`, your node is fully synced!

**Keep the terminal window open.**

#### Keys

Now you need to generate your `keys` in the `Pioneer app`. Go [here](#generate-your-keys) to do that now.

If you want to have the application talk to your own node, choose `Settings` in the sidebar, and change the `remote node/endpoint to connect to` to local node.


#### Re-start your node as a validator

If you haven't already, go [here](#generate-your-keys) to generate your keys.

1. Open the terminal that is running your node, and kill the session with `ctrl+c` (twice).
    * On windows, the first`ctrl+c` this will produce a long and confusing output.
2. Restart it again with the following command:
```
> joystream-node.exe --validator --key <0xMyLongRawSeed>
# If you want your node to have a non-random identifier:
> joystream-node.exe --name <nodename> --validator --key <0xYourLongSessionRawSeed>
# If you also want it show up in telemetry:
> joystream-node.exe --name <nodename> --telemetry-url ws://telemetry.polkadot.io:1024/ --validator --key <0xYourLongSessionRawSeed>

# Note: due to some issues with our nodes getting mixed up with nodes from the chainX network (see telemetry link),
# it might help your uptime by also passing:
--in-peers 100 --out-peers 100
# after the other flags. You can choose any number you like, but default is 25.
```
This time, the output should show a slightly different startup output:
```
Joystream Node
  version "version"-"your_OS"
  by Joystream, 2019
Chain specification: Joystream Staging Testnet
Node name: "nodename"
Roles: AUTHORITY
Best block: #"synced_height"
Local node address is: /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/30333/p2p/"your_node_key"
Listening for new connections on 127.0.0.1:9944.
Using authority key  "5YourJoySessionAddress"  # See Note
...
```
**Note**
If your `session` was generated as `Schnorrkel (sr25519)`, it will show a completely different address. If this happens, go back and generate a new [session key](#generate-your-keys) with `Edwards (ed25519)`. If you don't, your node will try to sign blocks with the wrong key. As a consequence, you will get slashed and kicked out as `Validator`.

#### Final Step

Now it's time to configure your kees to start validating. Go [here](#configure-your-validator-keys) to configure your `Validator` keys.

## Mac

* Every time something is written in `<brackets>`, this means you have to replace this with your input, without the `<>`.
* When something is written in `"double_quotes"`, it means the number/data will vary depending on your node or the current state of the blockchain.
* For terminal commands, `$` means you must type what comes after that on windows and mac respectively. `#` Means it's just a comment/explanation, and must not be typed.
```
# This is just a comment, don't type or paste it in your terminal!
$ cd ~/
# Only type/paste the "cd ~/, not the preceding $ !
```
#### Setup Node

Open the terminal (Applications->Utilities):

```
$ cd ~/
$ wget https://github.com/Joystream/substrate-node-joystream/releases/download/v1.0.0/joystream-node-1.0.0-osx-x86_64.zip
----
# If you don't have wget installed, paste the link in your browser save.
# Assuming it gets saved in your ~/Downloads folder:
$ mv ~/Downloads/joystream-node-1.0.0-osx-x86_64.zip ~/

#### Final Step

---

# In the Pioneer app (browser)

## Validator Setup

#### Generate your keys

While the node is syncing, you can start the process of setting up the rest.

1. Go the [Pioneer App](https://testnet.joystream.org/pioneer), and select `My keys` in the sidebar. Click the `Create keys` tab.

Names are entirely optional, but the next steps will be easier if you follow the system suggested.

2. Name your first keypair `session`, or at least something that contains the word. Ie `john-doe-session-key`.
3. In the dropdown in the field below, choose `Raw seed`. Note that each time you toggle between `Mnemonic` and `Raw seed`, you will generate a new key pair.
4. Copy the `"0xYourLongSessionRawSeed"`, and save it somewhere safe - like a password manager. You need this later!
5. Choose a password (this key will hold all your tokens!)
6. For the `session` key, you also need to select `Edwards (ed25519)` from the `Advanced creation options`.
7. Click `Save` -> `Create and backup keys`

Depending on your browser, you might have to confirm saving the `"5YourJoySessionAddress.json"`.

Repeat the steps two more times, but with different names, leaving you with three sets of keys as shown below:
* `stash`
* `controller`
* `session`

Note that you only *strictly need* the Raw seed for the `session` keypair, but it's safer to do it for all of them.

#### Configure your validator keys

In order to be a `validator`, you need stake. Note that you may have to refresh your browser if you're not seeing the options right away.

1. Still in the `My keys` sidebar of the [Pioneer App](https://testnet.joystream.org/pioneer), choose your `stash` key.
2. Click the `Get free tokens` link below your address, [or click here](https://testnet.joystream.org/faucet). Solve the captcha, and you should receive tokens.
3. Send some tokens to your `controller`. It needs to perform at least two transaction, but better to send ~10.
4. Now, click `Validators` in the sidebar, and then the `Validator staking` tab.
5. Locate the address/key named `stash`, and click `Bond Funds`.
6. In the popup window, choose your `controller` as the `controller account`.
7. Enter the amount you want to stake in the `value bonded` field. (It could be wise to leave a couple of Joy left).
8. In the `payment destination` dropdown, there are three options. Select the default `Stash account (increase the amount at stake)`, or go to [advanced](#bonding-preferences).
9.The button `bond` should be highlighted now. Click it.
10. Type in your password in the `unlock with password` field and click `sign and submit`.
11. Your `controller` account should now show a `Set Session Key` button. Click it.
12. In the popup, select your `session` as your `session key` in the dropdown. Confirm, sign and submit.
13. You need to check your node, which you started earlier. In the output `target=#"block_height"` should equal `best: #"synced_height"`. Do not proceed before those two values are identical, as your node will be dropped out from the validators if your node is not fully synced. If you did start your node with `--name <nodename>` parameter, then also can check if your node is fully synced from [Telemetry](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#list/Joystream%20Testnet%20v2).
14. Your `controller` account should now show a `Validate` button. Click it.
15. You can leave the `unstake threshold` and `payment preferences` as defaults, or go to [advanced](#validating-preferences). Confirm, sign and submit.

Refresh your browser, and select the `Validator Overview` tab. If your account shows under `next up`, wait for the next `era`, and you will be moved to the `validators` list.

# Advanced

## Run as a service

If you are running your node on a [linux](#linux) and want to have to run it as a [service](https://wiki.debian.org/systemd/Services), you can set it up this way.
Note that you should avoid this unless you know what you are doing, or is running your node on **your own VPS**, or a single board computer. With great (sudo) privileges, comes great responsibilities!

If you are already running as a `validator`, consider [unstaking](#unstaking) first, as you may experience some downtime if you make any mistakes in the setup.

#### Configure the service

Either as root, or a user with sudo privileges. If the latter, add `sudo` before commands.

```
$ cd /etc/systemd/system
# you can choose whatever name you like, but the name has to end with .service
$ touch joystream-node.service
# open the file with your favorite editor (I use nano below)
$ nano joystream-node.service
```

##### Example with user joystream

The example below assumes the following:
- You want to restart your node every 24h (`86400`s)
- You have setup a user `joystream` to to run the node
- The path to the `joystream-node` binary is `/home/joystream/joystream-node`

```
[Unit]
Description=Joystream Node
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=joystream
WorkingDirectory=/home/joystream/
ExecStart=/home/joystream/joystream-node \
        --out-peers 100 \
        --in-peers 100 \
        --validator \
        --key <0xYourLongSessionRawSeed> \
        --name <nodename>
Restart=always
RuntimeMaxSec=86400
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=8192

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

If you just want to have the node restart if it crashes, replace:

```
Restart=always
RuntimeMaxSec=86400
# with
Restart=on-failure
```


##### Example as root

The example below assumes the following:
- You want to restart your node every 24h (`86400`s)
- You have setup a user `root` to to run the node
- The path to the `joystream-node` binary is `/home/joystream/joystream-node`

```
[Unit]
Description=Joystream Node
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/root/
ExecStart=/root/joystream-node \
        --out-peers 100 \
        --in-peers 100 \
        --validator \

        --name <nodename>
Restart=always
RuntimeMaxSec=86400
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=8192

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

If you just want to have the node restart if it crashes, replace:

```
Restart=always
RuntimeMaxSec=86400
# with
Restart=on-failure
```

#### Starting the service

You can add/remove any `flags` as long as you remember to include `\` for every line but the last. Also note that systemd is very sensitive to syntax, so make sure there are no extra spaces before or after the `\`.

After you are happy with your configuration:

```
$ systemctl daemon-reload
# this is only strictly necessary after you changed the .service file after running, but chances are you will need to use it once or twice.
# if your node is still running, now is the time to kill it.
$ systemctl start joystream-node
# if everything is correctly configured, this command will not return anything.
# To verify it's running:
$ systemctl status joystream-node
# this will only show the last few lines. To see the latest 100 entries (and follow as new are added)
$ journalctl -n 100 -f -u joystream-node

# To make the service start automatically at boot:
$ systemctl enable joystream-node
```
You can restart the service with:
- `systemctl restart joystream-node`

If you want to change something (or just stop), run:
- `systemctl stop joystream-node`

Before you make the changes. After changing:

```
$ systemctl daemon-reload
$ systemctl start joystream-node
```

#### Errors

If you make a mistake somewhere, `systemctl start joystream-node` will prompt:
```
Failed to start joystream-node.service: Unit joystream-node.service is not loaded properly: Invalid argument.
See system logs and 'systemctl status joystream-node.service' for details.
```
Follow the instructions, and see if anything looks wrong. Correct it, then:

## Settings

If you don't want to use the default settings, here are some of the options you can configure.

#### Bonding preferences
The bonding preferences decides on how where your (Joy) staking rewards are distributed. There are three alternatives:
1. `Stash account (increase the amount at stake)` (default).

This automatically sends all rewards the `stash` address, where it gets bonded as additional stake. This will increase your probability of staying in the `validator` set.

2. `Stash account (do no increase the amount at stake)`

As like `1.` this automatically sends all rewards the `stash` address, but does *not* get bonded as stake, meaning you it will not help "guard" your spot in the `validator` set.

3. `Controller account`

This sends all rewards to the `controller`, at your disposal.

#### Validating preferences
1. The `unstake threshold` is the amount of times you can get slashed (for being offline) before you're automatically [unstaked](#unstaking). A low number can mean you stop being `validator` just because your internet is down a minute, but if you set the number too high, you will get slashed heavily if your node breaks down or you lose internet for an hour.

2. the `payment preferences` is how the (joy) staking rewards are split between yourself and any potential [nominators](#nominating). The default (0) means that the reward is split based on the amount of bonded stake the `validator` and `nominators` have put up. Example:

Let `v` [Joy] be the bonded tokens for the validator `stash`
Let `p` [Joy] be the `payment preference` decided by the validator
Let `n1` [Joy] be the bonded tokens for the nominator1 `stash`
Let `n2` [Joy] be the bonded tokens for the nominator2 `stash`
Let `r` [Joy] be the reward that `era`

```
# payout for the validator
p + (v/(v+n1+n2)*(r-p))
# payout for the nominator1
(n1/(v+n1+n2)*(r-p))
```


## Nominating

If you want to get some return on your tokens without running a node yourself, you can `nominate` another `validator` and get a share of their rewards.

This might also come in handy if there are too many `validators` and you don't have enough tokens get a spot, or if you have to shut down your own node for a while.

#### Generate keys
If you haven't already been through the process of setting up your `stash`, `controller` and `session` key, you first need to [generate your keys](#generate-your-keys). Note that you don't need a `session` key to nominate, so you can skip those steps.

#### Configure your nominating keys
In order to be a `nominator`, you need stake. Note that you may have to refresh your browser if you're not seeing the options right away. If you have previously been a `Validator`, or tried to do so, skip ahead to step `9.`.

1. In the `My keys` sidebar, choose your `stash` key.
2. Click the `Get free tokens` link below your address, [or click here](https://testnet.joystream.org/faucet). Solve the captcha, and you should receive tokens.
3. Send some tokens to your `controller`. It needs to perform at least two transaction, but better to send ~10.
4. Now, click `Validators` in the sidebar, and then the `Validator staking` tab.
5. Locate the address/key named `stash`, and click `Bond Funds`.
6. In the popup window, choose your `controller` as the `controller account`.
7. Enter the amount you want to stake in the `value bonded` field.
8. In the `payment destination` dropdown, there are three options. Select the default `Stash account (increase the amount at stake)`, or go to [advanced](#bonding-preferences).
9. Your `controller` account should now show a `Set Session Key` and a `Nominating` button. Click the latter.
10. In the popup, select/paste the `stash` address of the `Validator` you wish to nominate. Confirm, sign and submit.

In the next `era`, you will show as a `nominator` of the `Validator` you nominated.

# Troubleshooting
If you had any issues setting it up, you may find your answer here!

#### Session key

Did you accidentally choose `Schnorrkel (sr25519)`, instead of `Edwards (ed25519)` for your `session` key, and didn't notice before you configured your `Validator keys`? This can be resolved.

1. Go to `Validators` -> `Validator staking` and `Unstake`.

2. Generate a new `session` key with `Edwards (ed25519)`, restart your node, and replace the `raw seed` with the new one.

3. Then, choose `Settings` in the sidebar, and switch from `Basic features only` to `Fully featured`.

4. Go to `Extrinsics`, and select your `controller` key from the dropdown at the top. In the second dropdown, select `session`, and in the third, `setKey`. Finally, choose your new `session` key in the fourth and final dropdown, and submit.

5. Once it confirms, go back to `Validators` -> `Validator staking` and `Stake`.

In the `Next up`, your new `session` key should show, and match the `authority key` in your node. (minus the final 3 characters).

#### Unstaking

If you stop validating by killing your node before unstaking, you will get slashed and kicked from the `validator` set. If you know in advance (~1hr) you can do the following steps instead:

First, make sure you have set `Fully Featured` interface in the `Settings` sidebar.
1. In `Validator Staking`, click `Stop Validating` with your controller. This can also be done via `Extrinsic`: With `controller` -> `staking` -> `chill()`.

If you are just pausing the `validator` and intend to start it up later, you can stop here. When you are ready to start again, fire up your node, go to `Validator Staking`, and click `Validate`.

If you want to stop being a `validator` and move your tokens to other/better use, continue.

---

2. Next you must unbond. In `Extrinsics`, using the `controller`, select `staking` -> `unbond(value)` and choose how much you want to unbond, `<unbonding>`. Submit Transaction.

At this point, you can just wait 2hrs to be sure, and proceed to step `6.` Or:

---

3. Go to `Chain State` -> `staking` -> `ledger(AccountId): Option<StakingLedger>` with the `controller`. Output:
```
# If you have successfully initiated unstaking:
{"stash":"5YourStashAddress","total":<tot_bonded>,"active":,<act_bonded>:[{"value":<unbonding>,"era":<E_unbonded>}]}
# If you have not successfully initiated unstaking, or it has already completed:
{"stash":"5YourStashAddress","total":<tot_bonded>,"active":,"<act_bonded>":[]}
```
* `<tot_bonded>` Is the total amount you have staked/bonded
* `<act_bonded>` Is the amount of tokens that is not being unlocked
* `<unbonding>` Is the amount of tokens that is in the process of being freed
  * `<unbonding>` + `<act_bonded>` = `<tot_bonded>`
* `<E_unbonded>` Is the `era` when your tokens will be "free" to transfer/bond/vote

The `era` should only change every 600 blocks, but certain events may trigger a new era. To calculate when your funds are "free"
4. In `Chain State` -> `staking` -> `currentEra()`. Let output be `<E_current>`
5. In `Explored` collect `<blocks_in_era>/600` under era.
```
600(<E_unbonded> - <E_current> - 1) - <blocks_in_era> = <blocks_left>
(<blocks_left> * 6)/60 = <minutes_left>
```
After `<minutes_left>` has passed, ie. `<E_current>` = `<E_unbonded>`, your tokens should be free.
Repeat step `3.` if you want to confirm.
```
# If you have completed unstaking:
{"stash":"5YourStashAddress","total":<tot_bonded>,"active":,"<act_bonded>":[]}
```
---

6. In `Extrinsics`, using the `controller`, select `staking` -> `withdrawUnbonded()`

Your tokens should now be "free".

#### Restart validating after getting booted
If your node shut down before you had stopped validating and/or the grace period for `staking.chill` was completed, all you need to is start `validating` again from `Validator Staking`. Just make sure that your node is back up, and the `authority` key showing at node startup is the same as your `session` key.
**Note**
It doesn't matter if your `stash` has a `balance` < `bonded`.
