# Overview

This page contains all information on how to setup your node and becoming a `Validator` on the Joystream Testnets. It will be updated for improvements, and when something changes for new testnets.

If you want to earn more `Joy` tokens, but for some reason can't or won't become a `Validator`, you can [`Nominate`](#nominating) instead.

# Instructions

The instructions below covers Mac and Linux (64 bit and armv7). Windows binaries are currently not available. As a general note, remember to use your `stash` key when setting the `memo` to qualify for the monero rewards, not controller this time!

**Note**
If you are just running a node, and don't want to be a `Validator`, you can skip the flags
`--pruning archive` and `--validator`


# On Your Machine

---

## Mac

* Every time something is written in `<brackets>`, it means you have to replace this with your input, without the `<>`.
* When something is written in `"double_quotes"`, it means the number/data will vary depending on your node or the current state of the blockchain.
* For terminal commands, `$` means you must type what comes after that on windows and mac respectively. `#` Means it's just a comment/explanation, and must not be typed.
```
# This is just a comment, don't type or paste it in your terminal!
$ cd ~/
# Only type/paste the "cd ~/, not the preceding $ !
```
#### Setup Node

Open the terminal (Applications->Utilities):

```
$ cd ~/
$ wget https://github.com/Joystream/substrate-node-joystream/releases/download/v2.1.2/joystream-node-2.1.2-441c04b-x86_64-macos.tar.gz
$ wget https://github.com/Joystream/substrate-node-joystream/releases/download/v2.1.2/rome-testnet.json
----
# If you don't have wget installed, paste the link in your browser save.
# Assuming it gets saved in your ~/Downloads folder:
$ mv ~/Downloads/joystream-node-2.1.2-441c04b-x86_64-macos.tar.gz ~/
---
$ tar -vxf joystream-node-2.1.2-441c04b-x86_64-macos.tar.gz
$ ./joystream-node --chain rome-testnet.json --pruning archive --validator
```
- If you want your node to have a non-random identifier, add the flag `--name <nodename>`
- If you want to get a more verbose log output, add the flag `<nodename> --log runtime`

Your node should now start syncing the blockchain. The output should look like this:
```
Joystream Node

```
From the last line, notice `target=#"block_height"` and `best: #"synced_height"`
When the `target=#block_height`is the same as `best: #"synced_height"`, your node is fully synced!

**Keep the terminal window open.**

#### Keys

Now you need to generate your keys. Go [here](#generate-your-keys) to do that now.

#### Final Step

Now it's time to configure your keys to start validating. Go [here](#configure-your-validator-keys) to configure your `Validator`.

## Linux

* Every time something is written in `<brackets>`, this means you have to replace this with your input, without the `<>`.
* When something is written in `"double_quotes"`, it means the number/data will vary depending on your node or the current state of the blockchain.
* For terminal commands, `$` means you must type what comes after that on windows and mac respectively. `#` Means it's just a comment/explanation, and must not be typed.
```
# This is just a comment, don't type or paste it in your terminal!

---

# In the Pioneer app (browser)

## Validator Setup

#### Generate your keys

While the node is syncing, you can start the process of setting up the rest.

1. Go to the [Pioneer App](https://testnet.joystream.org/), and select `My keys` in the sidebar. Click the `Create keys` tab.

Names are entirely optional, but the next steps will be easier if you follow the system suggested.

2. For ease of use, name your first keypair "stash", or at least something that contains the word.

If you want to be able to recover your keys later, write down your mnemonic seed, key pair crypto type and secret derivation path.

3. Depending on your browser, you might have to confirm saving the json file.

4. Repeat the process for your "controller" key.

You should now have two sets of keys, namely:
- the "stash" key that will stake your funds
- the "controller" key that you will use to operate your validator

5. If you already have tokens, transfer the bulk to your "stash" account. If you don't yet have any tokens, [click here](https://faucet.joystream.org/). Solve the captcha, and you should receive tokens.

If you want/need more, ask in the telegram chat. Note that long time followers will receive more tokens than newcomers.

6. Send some tokens to your "controller". It needs to perform at least two transactions, but better to send ~10.

#### Configure your validator keys

In order to be a `Validator`, you need to stake. Note that you may have to refresh your browser if you're not seeing the options right away.

**IMPORTANT:** Read step 6. carefully. Your node needs to be fully synced, before proceeding to step 7.
1. In a terminal window on the machine/VPS your node is running, paste the following:
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "author_rotateKeys", "params":[]}' http://localhost:9933
```
If your node is running, this should return:
```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"0xa0very0long0hex0string","id":1}
```

This will save the session keys to your node. Make sure you don't close the window before copying the `0xa0very0long0hex0string` somewhere.

If your node is not running, is running on a different port, or `curl` is not installed, it will return something like:
```
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 9933: Connection refused
# or
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":-32601,"message":"Method not found"},"id":1}
```

2. Back in [Pioneer](testnet.joystream.org/), click `Validators` in the sidebar, and then the `Account actions` tab.
3. Click the `+ New stake` button, and select the keys from the first two dropdowns.
4. In the third field, enter the amount you want to stake (the maximum amount is the tokens in the account -1).
5. In the bottom dropdown, select the payment destination. Your selection here depends on your preferences.
6. If the transaction goes through, you should now see a `Set Session Key` button next to your "stash" and "controller" keys in this window. Click it, paste in your `0xa0very0long0hex0string` in the field, and confirm.
7. If the transaction goes through, you should now see a `Validate` button instead. Click it, and set your `reward commission`. Your selection here depends on your preferences.

Refresh your browser, and select the `Staking overview` tab. If your account shows under `next up`, wait for the next `era`, and you will be moved to the `validators` list.

# Advanced

## Run as a service

If you are running your node on a [Linux](#linux) and want to run it as a [service](https://wiki.debian.org/systemd/Services), you can set it up this way.
Note that you should avoid this unless you know what you are doing, are running your node on **your own VPS** or a single board computer. With great (sudo) privileges, comes great responsibilities!

If you are already running as a `validator`, consider [unstaking](#unstaking) first, as you may experience some downtime if you make any mistakes in the setup.

#### Configure the service

Either as root, or a user with sudo privileges. If the latter, add `sudo` before commands.

```
$ cd /etc/systemd/system
# you can choose whatever name you like, but the name has to end with .service
$ touch joystream-node.service
# open the file with your favorite editor (I use nano below)
$ nano joystream-node.service
```

##### Example with user joystream

The example below assumes the following:
- You want to restart your node every 24h (`86400`s)
- You have setup a user `joystream` to run the node
- The path to the `joystream-node` binary is `/home/joystream/joystream-node`

```
[Unit]
Description=Joystream Node
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=joystream
WorkingDirectory=/home/joystream/

##### Example as root

The example below assumes the following:
- You want to restart your node every 24h (`86400`s)
- You have setup a user `root` to run the node
- The path to the `joystream-node` binary is `/root/joystream-node`

```

```


#### Starting the service

You can add/remove any `flags` as long as you remember to include `\` for every line but the last. Also note that systemd is very sensitive to syntax, so make sure there are no extra spaces before or after the `\`.

After you are happy with your configuration:

```
$ systemctl daemon-reload
# this is only strictly necessary after you changed the .service file after running, but chances are you will need to use it once or twice.
# if your node is still running, now is the time to kill it.
$ systemctl start joystream-node
# if everything is correctly configured, this command will not return anything.
# To verify it's running:
$ systemctl status joystream-node
# this will only show the last few lines. To see the latest 100 entries (and follow as new are added)
$ journalctl -n 100 -f -u joystream-node

# To make the service start automatically at boot:
$ systemctl enable joystream-node
```
You can restart the service with:
- `systemctl restart joystream-node`

If you want to change something (or just stop), run:
- `systemctl stop joystream-node`

Before you make the changes. After changing:

```
$ systemctl daemon-reload
$ systemctl start joystream-node
```

#### Errors

If you make a mistake somewhere, `systemctl start joystream-node` will prompt:
```
Failed to start joystream-node.service: Unit joystream-node.service is not loaded properly: Invalid argument.
See system logs and 'systemctl status joystream-node.service' for details.
```
Follow the instructions, and see if anything looks wrong. Correct it, then:

```
$ systemctl daemon-reload
$ systemctl start joystream-node
```

## Rewards

For Substrate based blockchains, the validator rewards depends on some [dynamic parameters](#dynamic-parameters), that will change continuously, and some [fixed parameters](#fixed-parameters) in the chain spec.

### Dynamic Parameters
1. Active validators (`V_a`) - the number of `validators` currently running. This can be found:
  - in the [staking](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/staking) tab
  - or through a [chain state](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/chainstate) query of `staking.currentElected()` (and count them)
2. Issuance `I` - total tJOY tokens in circulation. This can be found:
  - in the [explorer](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/explorer) tab
  - or through a [chain state](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/chainstate) query of `balances.totalIssuance()`
3. Effective stake (`S_v,eff`) - ie. the total *effective* stake of the `validator` set, corresponding to the stake of the `validator` with the lowest *active* stake, which again is the sum of own stake, plus the stake of their [nominators](#nominating) if any. This can be found:
  - in the [staking](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/staking) tab, where one can look at the bottom entry among the active, and add the number(s) next to `bonded`.
  - or through a [chain state](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/chainstate) query of `staking.slotStake()`
  - then multiple the number with `V_a`
4. Max/Ideal validators `V_i` - the max number of active validators. This number can be changed through proposals, but was initially set to 20. Current value can be found:
  - in the [explorer](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/staking) tab
  - or through a [chain state](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/chainstate) query of `staking.validatorCount()`

Values that can be derived from this are:
- Staking rate `S_v,t = S_v,eff/I`

### Fixed Parameters
5. Minimum inflation, `I_min` - the min yearly inflation distributed to validators.
  - This number is currently set to `2.5%`.
6. Maximum inflation, `I_max` - the max yearly inflation distributed to validators.
  - This number is currently set to `30%`.
7. Ideal staking rate, `S_v,i` - the ideal ratio of effective stake over issuance for maximum validator rewards.
  - This number is currently set to `30%`.
8. Falloff, `F_v` - how quickly the validator rewards drop when the actual staking rate `S_v,t` exceeds the ideal staking rate `S_v,i`.
  - This number is currently set to `5%`.
9. Era (length), `E_l` - a period of time where the validator set remains constant. Unless there's a problem with the active validator set, an era lasts a fixed amount of sessions/epochs, which contains a fixed amount of blocks.
  - This number is currently set to 600 blocks (6-off sessions/epochs, each 100-off blocks).
  - This should to 3600 seconds or 1 hour, as the target blocktime is 6 seconds.

### Validator set and block production
At the end of each era, a new set of active validators `V_a` is determined by sorting all those that have declared their intention (eg. both the active and next up) by their stake, and selecting up to `V_i` in a descending order. These are treated as equals, and all will in practice have the same effective stake `S_v,eff/V_a`. They will randomly be asked to produce the next block, and will earn Era Points for each successful block authored.

### Total rewards calculation

As shown, the maximum total validator reward per year is 30% for `S_v,t=S_v,i`. With an era length of 600 blocks, each era, the maximum total, `R_vm,te` and individual, `R_vm,ie` reward for the validators are:

```
R_vm,te = I * I_max * E_l / year
= I * 0.3 * 3600s / (365.2425×24×60×60s)
= 0.0000342238*I

R_vm,ie = R_vm,te / V_a
= 0.0000342238*I/V_a
```

For `S_v,t<S_v,i`, the total rewards drop linearly down to `I_min` for `S_v,t=0`
For `S_v,t>S_v,i`, the total rewards can be found by:

```
R_v,te = I * (I_min + (I_max - I_min) * 2^((S_v,i − S_v,t) / F_v)) * E_l / year
```

#### Examples

The tJOY rewards for the validators can be calculated using this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13Bf7VQ7-W4CEdTQ5LQQWWC7ef3qDU4qRKbnsYtgibGU/edit?usp=sharing). The examples below should assist in using it:

#### Example A
In addition to the fixed parameters above, suppose:
```
V_a=20
I=100,000,000tJOY
S_v,eff=30,000,000tJOY
```

As `S_v,t=S_v,eff/I=0.3`, the maximum yearly inflation rate will be shared among the validators. Each era, the total, `R_v,te` and individual, `R_v,ie` reward for the validators are:

```
R_v,te = I * I_max * E_l / year
= 100,000,000tJOY * 0.3 * 3600s / (365.2425×24×60×60s)
= 3,422tJOY

R_v,ie = R_v,te / V_a
= 3,422tJOY / 20
= 1,71tJOY
```

#### Example B
In addition to the fixed parameters above, suppose:
```
V_a=20
I=100,000,000tJOY
S_v,eff=20,000,000tJOY
```

With `S_v,t=S_v,eff/I=0.2`. Each era, the total, `R_v,te` and individual, `R_v,ie` reward for the validators are:

```
R_v,te = (I * I_min + I * (I_max - I_min) * (S_v,t / S_v,i)) * E_l / year
= 2,376tJOY

R_v,ie = R_v,te / V_a
= 2,376tJOY / 20
= 119tJOY
```

#### Example C
In addition to the fixed parameters above, suppose:
```
V_a=20
I=100,000,000tJOY
S_v,eff=40,000,000tJOY
```

With `S_v,t=S_v,eff/I=0.4`. Each era, the total, `R_v,te` and individual, `R_v,ie` reward for the validators are:

```
R_v,te = I * (I_min + (I_max - I_min) * 2^((S_v,i − S_v,t) / F_v)) * E_l / year
= 1,069tJOY

R_v,ie = R_v,te / V_a
= 1,069tJOY / 20
= 53tJOY
```

More information on the staking, rewards and slashing mechanics can be found on the web3 foundations research papers   [here](https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/Token%20Economics.html).

## Settings

If you don't want to use the default settings, here are some of the options you can configure.

#### Bonding preferences
The bonding preferences decide on how your (Joy) staking rewards are distributed. There are three alternatives:
1. `Stash account (increase the amount at stake)` (default).

This automatically sends all rewards the `stash` address, where it gets bonded as an additional stake. This will increase your probability of staying in the `validator` set.

2. `Stash account (do no increase the amount at stake)`

As for 1. this automatically sends all rewards the `stash` address, but does *not* get bonded as stake, meaning you it will not help "guard" your spot in the `validator` set.

3. `Controller account`

This sends all rewards to the `controller`, at your disposal.

#### Validating preferences
The `reward commission` is how the (joy) staking rewards are split between yourself and any potential [nominators](#nominating). The default (0) means that the reward is split based on the amount of bonded stake the `validator` and `nominators` have put up. Example:

- Let `v` be the bonded tokens by the validators `stash` key
- Let `c` be the `reward commission` decided by the validator
- Let `n1` be the bonded tokens by the nominator1 `stash`
- Let `n2` be the bonded tokens by the nominator2 `stash`
- Let `r` be the reward for the individual validators that `era`

```
# payout for the validator
c+(r-c)*v/(v+n1+n2)
# payout for the nominator1
(n1/(v+n1+n2)*(r-c))
```

##### Example A
- assume there are 10 active validators in this era
- validator 1 bonds 100,000 tJOY
- validators 2-10 all bonds 300,000tJOY
- validator 1 has `reward commission` set to 100 tJOY
- nominator A bonds 130,000 tJOY, and nominates validator 1
- nominator B bonds 20,000 tJOY, and nominates validator 1
- thus, validator A has an effective stake of 250,000 tJOY
- after the end of the era, the total rewards are 25,000 tJOY

```
# All validators get an equal share, before sharing with nominators:
R_v = 25,000tJOY / 10 = 2,500tJOY

# payout for validator 1
R_v.1 = 100tJOY + 100,000tJOY * (2,500tJOY - 100tJOY) / 250,000tJOY = 1,060tJOY

# payout for nominator A
R_n.A = 130,000tJOY * (2,500tJOY - 100tJOY) / 250,000tJOY = 1,248tJOY

# payout for nominator B
R_n.B = 20,000tJOY * (2,500tJOY - 100tJOY) / 250,000tJOY = 192tJOY
```

##### Example B (advanced)

You have 200,000tJOY and wants to use tokens to `nominate`
- there are 10 active validators in this era
- validator 1 bonds 200,000 tJOY, with `reward commission` set to 100 tJOY
- validator 2 bonds 200,000 tJOY, with `reward commission` set to 50 tJOY
- validator 3 bonds 220,000 tJOY, with `reward commission` set to 20 tJOY
- validator 4 bonds 250,000 tJOY, with `reward commission` set to 0 tJOY
- validators 5-10 all bonds 250,000tJOY, with `reward commission` set to 5 tJOY

This means that the current `slotstake` is 200,000tJOY, and the effective stake for all validators are 200,000tJOY

```
# All validators get an equal share, before sharing with nominators:
R_v = 25,000tJOY / 10 = 2,500tJOY

# All tokens used to nominate 1

## Nominating

If you want to get some return on your tokens without running a node yourself, you can `nominate` another `validator` and get a share of their rewards.

This might also come in handy if there are too many `validators` and you don't have enough tokens get a spot, or if you have to shut down your own node for a while.

#### Generate your keys

1. Go to the [Pioneer App](https://testnet.joystream.org/), and select `My keys` in the sidebar. Click the `Create keys` tab.

Names are entirely optional, but the next steps will be easier if you follow the system suggested.

2. For ease of use, name your first keypair "stash", or at least something that contains the word.

If you want to be able to recover your keys later, write down your mnemonic seed, key pair crypto type and secret derivation path.

3. Depending on your browser, you might have to confirm saving the json file.

4. Repeat the process for your "controller" key.

You should now have two sets of keys, namely:
- the "stash" key that will stake your funds
- the "controller" key that you will use to operate your validator

5. If you already have tokens, transfer the bulk to your "stash" account. If you don't yet have any tokens, [click here](https://faucet.joystream.org/). Solve the captcha, and you should receive tokens.

If you want/need more, ask in the telegram chat. Note that long time followers will receive more tokens than newcomers.

6. Send some tokens to your "controller". It needs to perform at least two transactions, but better to send ~10.

#### Configure your validator keys

In order to be a `Nominator`, you need to stake. Note that you may have to refresh your browser if you're not seeing the options right away.

1. In [Pioneer](testnet.joystream.org/), click `Validators` in the sidebar, and then the `Account actions` tab.
2. Click the `+ New stake` button, and select the keys from the first two dropdowns.
3. In the third field, enter the amount you want to stake (the maximum amount is the tokens in the account -1).
4. In the bottom dropdown, select the payment destination. Your selection here depends on your preferences.
5. If the transaction goes through, you should now see a `Nominate` button next to your "stash" and "controller" keys in this window. Click it, and select the "stash" account(s) of the `Validator(s)` you want to `Nominate` for.
7. Once submitted, you will start earning a share of the rewards.

# Troubleshooting
If you had any issues setting it up, you may find your answer here!

## Unstaking
Due to an unfortunate error in Pioneer which we are working to fix, unstaking requires either lots of patience, or using the chain state/extrinsics tab for certain tasks:

### In Pioneer

If you stop validating by killing your node before unstaking, you will get slashed and kicked from the `Validator` set. If you know in advance (~1hr) you can do the following steps instead:

First, make sure you have set `Fully Featured` interface in the `Settings` sidebar.

1. In `Validator -> Account Actions`, click `Stop Validating`.

If you are just pausing the `validator` and intend to start it up later, you can stop here. When you are ready to start again, fire up your node, go to `Validator Staking`, and click `Validate`.

If you want to stop being a `validator` and move your tokens to other/better use, continue.

---

2. Next you must unbond. In the same window (`Validator -> Account Actions`), next to your keypair, click setting, then `Unbond funds`, and select the amount you wish to unbond.

After the transaction has gone through, you will see a new line below appearing, displaying `unbonding <amount> JOY` and an info icon.  Hovering over this with your cursor will tell you when your unbonding is complete, and you can go to the third and final step.

**Note**
Pioneer will display the "wrong" time here. Regardless of what it says, it will be about 24h.

To find out if you have completed your unbonding:
- [chain state](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/chainstate) query of `ledger(AccountId): Option<StakingLedger>` with the controller. Output:
```
# If you have successfully initiated unstaking:
{"stash":"5YourStashAddress","total":<tot_bonded>,"active":,<act_bonded>:[{"value":<unbonding>,"era":<E_unbonded>}]}
# If you have not successfully initiated unstaking, or it has already completed:
{"stash":"5YourStashAddress","total":<tot_bonded>,"active":,"<act_bonded>":[]}
```
- `<tot_bonded>` Is the total amount you have staked/bonded
- `<act_bonded>` Is the amount of tokens that is not being unlocked
- `<unbonding>` Is the amount of tokens that is in the process of being freed
  * `<unbonding>` + `<act_bonded>` = `<tot_bonded>`
- `<E_unbonded>` Is the `era` when your tokens will be "free" to transfer/bond/vote

The `era` should only change every 600 blocks, but certain events may trigger a new era. To calculate when your funds are "free"
- In `Chain State` -> `staking.currentEra()`. Let output be `<E_current>`

If `<E_unbonded>` >= `<E_current>`, you can complete the unbonding.


3. Once the unbonding is complete:
- In `Extrinsics`, using the `controller`, select `staking.withdrawUnbonded()`

You can now spend your tokens.

If you have waited long enough, you can instead perform the action in Pioneer:
- Go to the `Validator -> Account Actions` tab, you will see a new line displaying `unbonding <amount> JOY` and a lock icon.
- Click on the icon to complete the unbonding.

You can now spend your tokens.
